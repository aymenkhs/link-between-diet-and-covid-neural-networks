This project is the study of a correlation between COVID-19 Deaths and Diet intakes per country using neural networks using python and the library Pandas for data preprocessing and matlab for the training f the neural network.

# Data
For Covid deaths, we used the data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ["Daily  number  of  new  reported COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide"](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) prior to vaccination campaigns.
And for the diet intakes data, we used the data from the GDD (The Global Dietary Database) [Set of dietary factors in GDD 2018](https://www.globaldietarydatabase.org/) (creating an account is mandatory to access the data).
